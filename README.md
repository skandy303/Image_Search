# Image_Search
The program is supposed to produce images in relation to the keyword input into the program.
Please note that you will have to install the following libraries:

pip install jinja2,


pip install requests,


pip install os,


pip install template,


pip install json,



*The program will not work if a LaTeX reader is not installed, I used Texworks, I suggest using the same for optimal results*

*The API in use has limited requests per hour if JSON error were to appear it is because the amount of times API is used has exceded hourly limit, please wait for the next hour and try again*




Instructions:

1)Run 'imgsrch.py' file

2)Enter keyword

3)Open final.pdf
